# Pony.JS

Tiny Framework to create HTML entirely in JavaScript.

It's small but fast like a pony.

I wanted a framework with a lean abstraction layer of the DOM, directly based on vanilla JS.
Also, I didn't want to rely too much on "ECMAScript 6th Edition"-Features. They're cool, but still not compatible with every browser out there.

Pony.JS has mobile and embedded applications in mind.
Low memory footprint, modularity and high speed are a must!

Some features are based on concepts from Qt/QML.

## Modules

### Core

The DOM-Abstraction Layer serving the Pony-Prototype.

### Shedrow

All the little ponies ready to do the race!

This is a collection of aggregations of pony-objects, to help you build more complex DOM-Components (tables, navigations and lists).

### Signals

A Qt/QML-inspired way to handle events

### more coming soon
